<p style="text-align: justify;">Easy homemade sauce for your enchiladas, fast!<br /><br /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ingredients :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- 2 pounds tomatillos.<br />- 1 large sweet onion.<br />- 1-3 jalape&ntilde;os, de-seeded or not depending on desired spice level.<br />- 2 cloves garlic.<br />- 3 scallions.<br />- 1 tablespoon canola oil.<br />- 1/2 cup cilantro.<br />- 1 lime.<br />- 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock (optional, have ready to get sauce to desired thickness).<br />- Salt and pepper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Directions :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Roughly chop all your vegetables, then heat the canola oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and cook the vegetables until soft. Confused by the tomatillos? Just take off that weird husk, rinse them off (they will still be sort of sticky) and slice out the top stem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Remove from heat, mix in the cilantro and lime juice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Using an immersion blender, blend until it is smooth. If you use a regular blender, keep your hand firmly on the lid, because the sauce is hot and will blow the top off if you don&rsquo;t. If it looks thick, you can add a little water or chicken stock to thin it out enough that it runs easily through a slotted spoon. Season with salt and pepper and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
